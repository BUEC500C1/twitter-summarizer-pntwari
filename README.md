# CITY WEATHER
twitter-summarizer-pntwari created by GitHub Classroom

## Purpose
The code pulls weather data for particular cities. The decision to use the cities instead of the airports for the weather was a deliberate one. A customer usually looks for the destination city for the weather, not the airport. And often, the airport is within the city borders for most cities. Therefore, using the city instead of the airport coordinates is a natural move. 

## How to Use
To use this program, have a city in mind (and its correct spelling) as an input. One needs the country code as well. There is a list of country codes included in this folder. Simply look up the country, and use the two-letter ISO 3166 code as such: Boston,US. This is the input for the program. Another example is "George Town,MY" to represent George Town in the Penang state of Malaysia. 

The program will give the current overall weather and the temperature in F in that city in addition to the forecast of 24 hours ahead. 

Includes other files for demonstrating the json file type and format, which uses the Singapore Changi Airport as an example. The json shows how information may be categorized to create an efficient data package.
